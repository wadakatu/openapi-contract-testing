     * matching, so enforcement rebuilds the identical fingerprint from the
     * raw request context alone.

     * During an enforcement run a baselined decode failure is suppressed the
     * same way — absent body, validation continues, same-side body verdicts
     * excluded — while an unbaselined one re-throws as the normal failure.
