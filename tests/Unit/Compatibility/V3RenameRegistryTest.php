/**
 * The reverse direction of {@see DeprecationRegistryTest}.
 *
 * That test scans `src/` for `Deprecations::notice()` calls and requires each
 * one to be registered, which catches a deprecation nobody registered. It
 * cannot catch the opposite and more likely failure: a rename that ships with
 * no notice at all. Nothing is emitted, so nothing is scanned, and the registry
 * stays as correct — and as empty — as it was.
 *
 * This test starts from `docs/adr/0005-v3-configuration-and-cli-naming.md`
 * instead. The ADR fixes every v3 spelling, so every old spelling it names is a
 * removal that `docs/versioning.md` requires a v2 minor to deprecate first. The
 * fixture transcribes those spellings and records which channel each one uses;
 * `unstaged_count` is the ratchet that turns the review rule in
 * [#499](https://github.com/studio-design/gesso/issues/499) into an arithmetic
 * one.
 *
 * The ordering it protects is unrecoverable, which is why it exists:
 * `docs/versioning.md` notes that the first breaking commit on `main` turns the
 * pending release into `3.0.0`, after which no further v2 release can be cut.
 * A rename whose deprecation was forgotten before that point cannot be given
 * one afterwards without spending another major.
