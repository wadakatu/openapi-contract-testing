# SDK response round-trip testing

Server response validation proves that the provider emits spec-valid data. It
does not prove that a generated client SDK can deserialize every shape allowed
by the same response schema. `OpenApiResponseExplorer` closes that boundary by
generating valid response payloads, handing them to your SDK, and verifying the
SDK's re-encoded output.

## Plain PHPUnit

Configure specs in the normal test bootstrap, then select one response by its
method, path, wire status, and optional content type:

```php
use Studio\Gesso\Fuzz\GeneratedResponseCase;
use Studio\Gesso\Fuzz\OpenApiResponseExplorer;
use Studio\Gesso\Spec\OpenApiSpecLoader;

OpenApiSpecLoader::configure(__DIR__ . '/specs');

OpenApiResponseExplorer::explore(
    'front',
    'POST',
    '/oauth/introspect',
    200,
    contentType: 'application/json',
    seed: 1,
)->each(function (GeneratedResponseCase $case): void {
    // The generated SDK must accept every spec-valid payload.
    $model = ObjectSerializer::deserialize(
        $case->bodyAsObject(),
        IntrospectResponse::class,
    );

    // The SDK must also preserve every generated value when it re-encodes.
    $case->assertRoundTrip(
        ObjectSerializer::sanitizeForSerialization($model),
    );
});
```

Omit `contentType` to select the first JSON-compatible media type exactly as
response validation does. Status resolution also shares validator behavior:
an exact response key wins, followed by an `X00` range key and `default`.

## Named component models

Some generated SDK models map directly to `components.schemas` entries and are
not reachable through one useful operation/status pair. Select those models by
their exact, case-sensitive component name:

```php
OpenApiResponseExplorer::exploreComponent(
    specName: 'front',
    schemaName: 'IntrospectResponse',
    seed: 1,
)->each(function (GeneratedResponseCase $case): void {
    $model = ObjectSerializer::deserialize(
        $case->bodyAsObject(),
        IntrospectResponse::class,
    );

    $case->assertRoundTrip(
        ObjectSerializer::sanitizeForSerialization($model),
    );
});
```

Component schemas use the spec's OpenAPI version, JSON Schema dialect,
response-side read/write semantics, and discriminator context. The returned
cases have `null` `status` and `contentType`, while `replaySnippet()` records an
`exploreComponent()` call. Unknown, malformed, recursive, and otherwise
unsupported component schemas throw instead of producing an empty green run.

## Exercise every mapped response in a spec

Use `exploreSpec()` when one test should discover the selected operations and
exercise every mapped JSON response schema:

```php
$summary = OpenApiResponseExplorer::exploreSpec('front', seed: 1)
    ->includeTags(['public'])
    ->mapResponse(
        operationId: 'introspect',
        status: 200,
        decode: static fn (GeneratedResponseCase $case): mixed =>
            ObjectSerializer::deserialize(
                $case->bodyAsObject(),
                IntrospectResponse::class,
            ),
        encode: static fn (mixed $model): mixed =>
            ObjectSerializer::sanitizeForSerialization($model),
    )
    ->failOnUnmapped()
    ->assertRoundTrips();
```

Mappings are explicit `(operationId, declared response status)` pairs. The
status accepts an integer/exact string such as `200`, a range key such as
`2XX`/`2xx`, or `default`. One mapping applies to every JSON media type under
that response; Gesso never guesses model names. The decode callback receives
the `GeneratedResponseCase` and `ExploredOperation`. The encode callback
receives the decoded value followed by the same case and operation, so either
callback can use response and replay metadata.

The plan supports the same include/exclude filters for tags, methods, paths,
operation IDs, and deprecated operations as whole-spec request exploration.
Deprecated operations are excluded by default. Operations without an
`operationId` remain discoverable, but their schemas are mapping gaps because
there is no stable mapping key to guess.

Every operation receives a crc32-derived seed based on the spec name, method,
path, and global seed. Mapping registration and spec traversal order therefore
do not change an existing operation's generated cases. `extraCases` appends
the requested deterministic cases to every explored schema.

When all mapped callbacks succeed, `assertRoundTrips()` returns a
`ResponseSpecExplorationSummary` with executed operation, response-schema, and
case counts plus structured skips. Unmapped JSON schemas are always skips with
`mappingGap: true`; `failOnUnmapped()` promotes all such gaps to one assertion
failure after discovery. No-content, non-JSON-only, missing-schema, and
`itemSchema` responses are explicit non-mapping skips with structured reasons.
Malformed spec nodes fail immediately with the shared response resolver's
location-aware diagnostic.

Decoder exceptions and encode/round-trip failures are collected across all
remaining cases, then reported under separate `Decode failures` and
`Round-trip failures` headings. Each row includes the operation, declared and
representative wire statuses, content type, seed, case, pinned branch, and
`OpenApiResponseExplorer::explore()` replay expression.

## SDK exercise coverage

Gesso records an SDK exercise attempt immediately before it invokes a decoder
callback. Both supported callback paths contribute:

- `GeneratedResponseCases::each()` for one operation response;
- the decode callbacks executed by `exploreSpec(...)->assertRoundTrips()`.

Generating a collection or iterating it manually with `foreach` does not prove
that a decoder ran and records nothing. Use `each()` when you want direct
exploration to contribute to SDK exercise coverage. Named
`exploreComponent()` cases also remain outside this metric because a component
does not identify a response `(method, path, status, content-type)`.

The denominator is derived independently from the live spec. It contains every
resolved JSON-compatible response media type with a schema, and excludes
no-content responses, non-JSON media types, missing or non-JSON schemas, and
OpenAPI 3.2 `itemSchema` streams. An attempt counts even if the decoder then
throws: coverage answers whether the boundary was exercised, while the thrown
exception or round-trip mismatch remains a normal test failure.

The console, Markdown, HTML, JUnit, and JSON coverage reports show exercised
and unexercised SDK response schemas. See the
[coverage threshold gate](coverage.md#coverage-threshold-gate) to enforce a
minimum percentage.

## Laravel

The `ExploresOpenApiEndpoint` trait uses the same spec-name precedence as the
validation traits: method/class `#[OpenApiSpec]`, `openApiSpec()`, then
`default_spec`.

```php
use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;
use Studio\Gesso\Attribute\OpenApiSpec;
use Studio\Gesso\Fuzz\GeneratedResponseCase;
use Studio\Gesso\Laravel\ExploresOpenApiEndpoint;

#[OpenApiSpec('front')]
final class IntrospectSdkTest extends TestCase
{
    use ExploresOpenApiEndpoint;

    public function test_sdk_accepts_every_introspection_shape(): void
    {
        $this->exploreResponseSchema(
            'POST',
            '/oauth/introspect',
            200,
            seed: 1,
        )->each(function (GeneratedResponseCase $case): void {
            $model = ObjectSerializer::deserialize(
                $case->bodyAsObject(),
                IntrospectResponse::class,
            );
            $case->assertRoundTrip(ObjectSerializer::sanitizeForSerialization($model));
        });
    }
}
```

For a spec-wide plan, replace the single-response call with
`$this->exploreResponseSpec(seed: 1)`. It returns the same
`OpenApiResponseSpecExploration` builder shown above while resolving the spec
name from the method/class attribute, `openApiSpec()`, or `default_spec`.

Schema-to-model mapping deliberately stays in your test. Gesso does not guess
class names or conventions from openapi-generator, Kiota, or another SDK tool.

## Branch-complete cases

For a fixed converted schema and seed, the explorer produces at least one case
for every branch of every reachable supported choice point:

- `oneOf` and `anyOf` branches;
- `if`/`then`/`else` and conditional `allOf` branches;
- nullable branches;
- presence and omission of optional object properties, including choice points
  nested beneath those properties.

The number of cases is therefore derived from the schema. `extraCases` defaults
to `0` and appends deterministic rotation-only cases when you want more values;
it does not replace any branch-pinned case. The existing supported-subset and
enumeration bounds remain loud. Every generated value is self-validated before
your callback runs. Omitting `seed` uses the replayable default seed `0`; the
effective seed is stored on every case and included in `replaySnippet()`.

## Case values and fidelity

`GeneratedResponseCase` is readonly and exposes:

| Member | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `body` | Raw generated PHP value |
| `bodyAsObject()` | JSON round-trip with objects decoded as `stdClass`; arrays and scalars retain their JSON shape |
| `bodyAsArray()` | Lossy associative compatibility view: empty objects become arrays, even when nested; scalar bodies throw. Prefer `bodyAsObject()` for SDK input |
| `status`, `contentType` | Selected wire status and declared media-type key; both are `null` for named components |
| `seed`, `caseIndex` | Deterministic replay identity |
| `pinnedBranch` | Target JSON Pointer plus zero-based branch, for example `/properties/aud/oneOf@0`; `null` for an extra case |
| `replaySnippet()` | Minimal `explore(...)` or `exploreComponent(...)` reproduction |

`assertRoundTrip()` makes two assertions in order:

1. The re-encoded value must satisfy the same converted JSON Schema used to
   generate the case, including the selected OpenAPI dialect and discriminator
   enforcement.
2. Every generated object key/value must survive recursively. SDK-specific
   extra object keys are allowed, while generated JSON lists and scalar values
   compare exactly, including scalar types.

Assertion failures include the seed, case index, pinned branch descriptor, and
replay snippet. Exceptions thrown directly by the SDK decoder remain visible to
PHPUnit unchanged.

## Loud unsupported responses

Exploration never returns an empty collection. Resolution failures and response
shapes that cannot represent one buffered JSON document throw
`InvalidArgumentException` with a structured outcome name. These include:

- responses without a `content` block, including 204-style responses;
- responses declaring only non-JSON media types;
- selected media types without `schema`;
- selected non-JSON schemas; and
- OpenAPI 3.2 streaming responses using `itemSchema`.

Use `explore()` for one resolved operation response, `exploreComponent()` for
one named model schema, or `exploreSpec()` for explicit mappings across a spec.
