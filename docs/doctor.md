# Doctor command

`gesso doctor` answers one focused question before the test suite starts: can this package load and enforce the selected OpenAPI contract as configured?

It is not a replacement for a semantic or style linter such as Spectral or Redocly.

## Scope

`gesso doctor` is a preflight for a local OpenAPI file. It confirms Gesso can load and enforce the document — version and dialect, references, warned-about keywords, structurally valid operations — and exits non-zero when it can't. It does not fetch a deployed spec URL, and it does not compare the checked-in spec against what a running service returns. `--allow-remote-refs` only covers `$ref` targets from the local entry document.

## Basic usage

```bash
vendor/bin/gesso doctor \
  --spec=openapi/front.yaml \
  --strip-prefix=/api
```

The command checks file readability and parser availability, the declared OpenAPI version and JSON Schema dialect, internal and external references, schema keywords that the validator warns about, and structurally valid operations, request bodies, and response definitions. It also reports recognized features that are intentionally not enforced.

Request-body checks share the runtime validator's structural rules for
`requestBody`, `content`, media-type entries, `schema`, `itemSchema`, and request
`encoding` maps and entries. Doctor reports all malformed nodes as `structure`
errors, including media types a particular request would not select and
operations without responses in OpenAPI 3.1/3.2. These checks do not turn doctor
into a complete OpenAPI linter: for compatibility, missing or null request-body
and request-content nodes retain the runtime behavior, and response-side
`encoding` is not inspected.

JSON and YAML are supported. YAML requires the optional `symfony/yaml` package, just like runtime validation.

## Multiple specs

Repeat `--spec`, or provide comma-separated paths:

```bash
vendor/bin/gesso doctor \
  --spec=openapi/front.yaml \
  --spec=openapi/admin.json \
  --strip-prefix=/api
```

`--phpunit-snippet` prints the equivalent extension configuration when all entry documents share one directory. The snippet uses each entry document's filename without its extension as the configured spec name.

Local external references are confined to each entry document's directory by
default. If an entry and its shared schemas use sibling directories, pass their
narrowest trusted common parent:

```bash
vendor/bin/gesso doctor \
  --spec=openapi/bundled/front.yaml \
  --local-ref-root=openapi \
  --phpunit-snippet
```

The generated PHPUnit snippet then uses `spec_base_path="openapi"` and the
spec name `bundled/front`. Targets that escape the canonical root through
`../`, an absolute path, or a symlink are rejected; those forms remain valid
when their canonical targets stay inside the root.

## Acknowledged unvalidatable security schemes

When the test suite acknowledges an unvalidatable security scheme by name (see [Acknowledging an unvalidatable security scheme](setup.md#acknowledging-an-unvalidatable-security-scheme)), pass the same names so the doctor report reflects the acknowledgement:

```bash
vendor/bin/gesso doctor \
  --spec=openapi/front.yaml \
  --acknowledge-unvalidatable-scheme=ClientBasicAuth
```

The scheme is still listed as a skipped feature, marked as acknowledged instead of prompting for a separate authentication test. A name that is not defined in `components.securitySchemes`, or that names a scheme the validator can enforce, is reported as a `configuration` warning so the acknowledged list cannot rot.

## HTTP references

Remote references remain opt-in because diagnostics must not access the network unexpectedly:

```bash
vendor/bin/gesso doctor \
  --spec=openapi/root.yaml \
  --allow-remote-refs \
  --remote-ref-host=specs.example.com \
  --remote-ref-max-bytes=10485760
```

The command automatically uses an installed Guzzle (`guzzlehttp/guzzle` plus `guzzlehttp/psr7`) or Symfony HttpClient PSR-18 implementation. Every permitted host must be listed with `--remote-ref-host`; repeat the option when a trusted contract intentionally spans hosts. A nested `$ref` that switches to an unlisted host is rejected before any request is sent. Each remote document is limited to 10 MiB by default; use `--remote-ref-max-bytes=<positive integer>` only when a trusted contract requires a larger bound. Without `--allow-remote-refs`, an HTTP(S) `$ref` is reported as a reference error with an actionable hint. Network failures, oversized or malformed remote documents, content-type mismatches, and reference cycles also exit non-zero.

## Installed version

`gesso --version` is a global flag on the binary, matched before any subcommand:

```bash
$ vendor/bin/gesso --version
gesso 2.4.0
```

It writes to STDOUT, writes nothing to STDERR, and exits `0`. When Composer's `InstalledVersions` metadata cannot be read it prints `gesso unknown` — the same sentinel the JSON documents emit — and still exits `0`, so a CI script or an agent probing for the version always gets an answer rather than a usage error. `gesso --help` lists it under `Global options:`.

## Machine-readable output

Use `--format=json` for CI and tooling. The top-level `schemaVersion` is currently `1` and will change if the machine-readable contract requires an incompatible revision.

```json
{
    "schemaVersion": 1,
    "tool": {
        "name": "studio-design/gesso",
        "version": "2.4.0"
    },
    "status": "ok",
    "summary": {
        "specs": 1,
        "operations": 4,
        "responses": 7,
        "errors": 0,
        "warnings": 0,
        "skipped": 0
    },
    "specs": [],
    "issues": [],
    "phpunit": null
}
```

`tool` is `{ "name": "studio-design/gesso", "version": "<composer version or 'unknown'>" }`, the same block the [coverage JSON](coverage-json-schema.md) and [validation JSON](validation-json-schema.md) documents carry. `"unknown"` is emitted when Composer's `InstalledVersions` metadata is unavailable; the field is always a string.

Additive changes — a new field such as `tool`, or a new `category` slug — keep `schemaVersion` at `1`. Removals, renames, and type changes bump it.

Every issue has a stable `severity`, `category`, `spec`, `message`, and nullable `suggestion` field. Severities are:

- `error`: the contract cannot be loaded or enforced as configured;
- `warning`: validation can proceed, but the package detected a compatibility limitation;
- `skipped`: a recognized contract feature is not currently enforced and needs a separate test.

Categories currently emitted by schema version 1 are `io`, `parser`, `version`, `dialect`, `references`, `structure`, `keyword`, `feature`, `dependency`, `configuration`, `spec`, `compatibility`, and `internal`. Consumers should branch on `severity` and `category`, not the human-readable message.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| `0` | All selected specs are compatible. Warnings and skipped features may still be present. |
| `1` | At least one diagnostic error prevents reliable contract enforcement. |
| `2` | The command-line invocation is invalid, such as a missing `--spec` or unknown format. |

Treat both `1` and `2` as CI failures. Always inspect warnings and skipped features even when the exit code is `0`.
